# Mario_Game_Prototype
Prototype Mario game made with the unity engine


Finite state machines was implemented since Mario has different movement states: idle, walking and jumping. In case more movement states were to be added, it can be done in a very scalable and efficient way since every state is it's own class. Also Mario has different states where he growns big and one state where he is able to shoot fireballs. It's important that there is a finite state machine for this feature.
